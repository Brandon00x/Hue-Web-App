# Hue Touchscreen Console

Hue Touchscreen Console allows you to control your Hue lights and view weather information.
It is designed to run on Raspberry Pi touch screens but will work on other devices.

## Setup

Install:
`npm i`

Run Linux/Mac: 
`npm start`

Run Windows: `npm run server` and `npm run windows`

## Future Features

Currently this app was just designed to control Hue lights.
It's currently designed for 800x480 screens like the raspberry pi touchscreen.
I will update the CSS to be responsive in the future for all screens such as mobile and tablets.
In the future it will probably be modified to control other smart home features and include more data.
